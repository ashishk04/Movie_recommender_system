# Movie Recommendation ML Project
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation ML project! This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The machine learning model used in this project analyzes various factors such as genre, ratings, and user behavior to suggest movies that align with individual tastes.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

## Prerequisites: <h5>Ensure that you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed. You can find the necessary dependencies in the requirements.txt file.</h5>

## Dataset: <h5> Obtain a suitable dataset for movie information and user ratings. The dataset should include movie attributes like genre, director, cast, ratings, and user preferences.</h5>

## Data Preprocessing:<h5> Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.</h5>

## Feature Engineering:<h5> Extract relevant features from the dataset that can contribute to the movie recommendation process. This may involve creating new features or transforming existing ones.</h5>

## Model Training: <h5> Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Consider using algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches for movie recommendations.</h5>

## Model Evaluation: <h5>Evaluate the performance of your trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean average precision.</h5>

## User Interface: <h5> Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations. This can be a web application, command-line interface, or any other suitable interface.</h5>

## Deployment:<h5> Deploy your movie recommendation system, ensuring it is accessible to users. Host it on a server or a cloud platform to handle user requests efficiently.</h5>
